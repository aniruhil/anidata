# {anidata}

This is a github repo for my data package. This is the first data package I built, primarily to make it easier to update and share various data-sets I use in my R courses and workshops. Some of the files I use in raw csv mode are very large, and that causes all sorts of headaches for students. This package shrinks them via using the `*.rda` format and so one hurdle solved right there! Another benefit is not having to mess with having students pulling the data from some cloud-based solution; both their comfort with cloud-solutions and network speeds, etc often get in the way.
